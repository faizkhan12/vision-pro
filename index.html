            Our most advanced <br />
            Spatial Audio system ever.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Dual-driver audio pods positioned next to each ear deliver
            personalized sound while letting you hear what’s around you. Ambient
            <span> Spatial Audio </span> makes sounds feel like they’re coming
            from your surroundings. And with audio raytracing, Vision Pro
            analyzes your room’s acoustic properties — including the physical
            materials — to adapt and match sound to your space.And if you want
            to use headphones with Apple Vision Pro, the new AirPods Pro (2nd
            generation) offer the perfect experience, featuring Lossless Audio
            with ultra-low latency enabled by the H2 chip in both devices.
